# conformalbayes

Conformal Bayesian Computation in Stan with post-processing in Numpy and Numba. Broadly follows this [repo](https://github.com/edfong/conformal_bayes/) and the corresponding paper. 

- [ ] cf. Numba speed-up with JAX.
- [ ] cf. width of conformal intervals with the jackknife (+) approach in Barber et al.
- [ ] refactor the package part of this repo
