# conformalbayes

Implementing conformal bayesian computation in Stan. Follows this [repo](https://github.com/edfong/conformal_bayes/) and the corresponding paper. 

Tbd. 

- comparison with the predicitve intervals by importance sampling the leave-one-out residuals (jacknife+).
- use numba for speed-ups
